Although that was not a problem at the time of booking, as we only had 3 people it turned out at short notice that in fact we needed a 4th space. Calling to the hotel did not resolve the matter  and were told that the booking we had was non-refundable, so presented quite a dilemma. We decided to continue and did make do okay, but found when we arrived, that the likely reason for the insistence on 3-persons only, was that there was not enough convenient space around the table if a 4th person was . present. I did not bring up this point to the hotel management and while I understand the hotel's reluctance to acknowledge this limitation,  my son had come from Singapore at short notice and we did want him to come along on out trip. Our stay was only for a weekend and given what I feel were extenuating circumstances, I feel the hotel could have been more accommodating in this case.

The heating get element, the cover was completely blown off with wires and internal works exposed. It's a good thing we didn't bring the children. Trying to take a shower was a painful event with pressure so extreme and being forced out between calcius buildup on the shower head. Cover any body part you don't want skinned off by that. The shower curtain, which I can imagine was someone's favorite joke, literally was so cheap and flimsy that it would swallow your entire body. I had to have my husband hold the curtain in place and me for him just so we could actually wash ourselves.\\nThe staff was horrendous. Every meal we had, each server would forget something for our meal. Everything we would be taken to our table, the staff would advise us that they only had 1 or 2 items available from the menu. Not any selection at all. They were rude, horrible trained and extremely slow.
